# Ruler
***

*As I remember, this code was written in 2006*

## What is it?
Just values converter. 

For example, you can define init values:
**7200.0 second = 2 hour** and the next string you can define question **5.6 second = ? hour**. Ruler will replace **?** question sign with the answer.


## Using

1.  Compile:
     just run **g++ ruler.cpp -o ruler** or run **make**
2.  Run batch files:
     **ruler < batch.file**
